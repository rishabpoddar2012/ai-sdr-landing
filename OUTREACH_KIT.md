## 📧 COLD EMAIL SEQUENCE

### Email 1: The Value Bomb (Day 1)
**Subject:** 3 companies hiring [their service] this week

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I help agencies like {{Company}} find high-intent leads without cold calling.

Quick question: Would you be interested in 50 qualified leads from companies 
actively looking for {{service}}?

I found these 3 in the last 24 hours:

1. [Company A] - Posted on Hacker News "Who is Hiring", budget $50K/month
2. [Company B] - Upwork job posted 3 hours ago, willing to pay $5K setup
3. [Company C] - Series A startup hiring SDRs, needs lead gen

All verified, scored, and ready to contact.

I built an AI system that monitors Hacker News, Reddit, Upwork, and LinkedIn 
24/7 to find these opportunities.

Want me to send you 10 free leads to test quality?

Best,
Rishab

### Email 2: The Case Study (Day 3, if no reply)
**Subject:** How {{SimilarAgency}} got 3 clients in 7 days

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick follow-up on my last email about qualified leads.

Wanted to share what happened with {{SimilarAgency}}, a {{CompanySize}} 
agency similar to yours:

Week 1 with our AI SDR:
→ 47 qualified leads delivered
→ 8 meetings booked
→ 3 clients signed ($24K MRR total)

Their founder said: "We went from cold outreach to warm conversations. 
The leads actually want to talk to us."

The difference? Our AI finds companies posting "hiring signals" — 
job posts, funding announcements, scaling announcements — and scores 
them for intent.

No more buying stale lead lists.

Still interested in 10 free leads to test?

Rishab

### Email 3: The Breakup (Day 7, if no reply)
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I don't want to be that person who keeps emailing if you're not interested.

Quick last try:

I'm offering 50 free, AI-scored leads to the first 10 agencies this week.

No credit card. No calls. Just leads delivered to your inbox.

If you're not interested, just reply "no thanks" and I'll close your file.

If you are, reply "yes" and I'll send your first 10 leads within 24 hours.

Either way, I appreciate your time.

Best,
Rishab

## 💬 LINKEDIN OUTREACH

### Connection Request (Use this first!)
```
Hi {{FirstName}}, saw {{Company}} is scaling fast. 
I help agencies find qualified leads from hiring signals. 
Worth connecting?
```

### LinkedIn DM (After they accept)
```
Thanks for connecting {{FirstName}}!

Quick question — how does {{Company}} currently find new clients?

I built something that might help. It monitors Hacker News, Reddit, 
Upwork, and LinkedIn for companies posting hiring signals 
(= they have budget and urgency).

Found 3 companies this week looking for {{service}}:
• [Company] - $50K/mo budget
• [Company] - Hiring 5 SDRs (need lead gen)
• [Company] - Series A, scaling marketing

Want me to send you the full list? Free, no strings.
```

## 🐦 TWITTER/X DM STRATEGY

### For Agency Founders:
```
Hey {{FirstName}}, love your content on performance marketing.

Quick question — what's your biggest bottleneck right now: 
lead quality or lead volume?

I built an AI that finds companies posting "we're hiring" + 
"need agency help" signals. Might be useful.

Worth a 2-min chat?
```

## 💰 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

**Starter ($299):** For solo founders testing
- Anchor price — makes Growth look reasonable
- Limited features — pushes upgrades

**Growth ($799):** ← PUSH THIS HARD
- Most agencies fit here
- "Popular" badge = social proof
- 2x leads for 2.5x price = good value

**Agency ($2,000):** For big players
- Price anchoring makes Growth look cheap
- White-label = resell opportunity
- Only mention if they ask for enterprise

**Strategy:** 
- Offer 50 free leads (no credit card)
- After trial, push Growth plan
- Mention "Agency" only if they need >2K leads

## 🎁 BONUS: OBJECTION HANDLING

**"We already have a lead gen process"**
"Perfect! AI SDR doesn't replace your process — it feeds it higher-quality leads. Think of it as a pre-filter. Try 50 free leads and compare quality to your current source."

**"$799/month is expensive"**
"One client from our 'Hot' leads pays for 6 months. {{SimilarAgency}} closed 3 clients in their first week. Want to test with free leads first?"

**"How is this different from ZoomInfo/Apollo?"**
"ZoomInfo gives you contact data. We give you intent data — companies actively hiring and posting about scaling. Big difference in conversion rates."

**"I need to think about it"**
"Totally understand. I'll follow up next week. In the meantime, want me to send you 10 free leads so you can see the quality?"

---

**Ready to start outreach?** 

I recommend starting with your warm network (ex-colleagues, LinkedIn connections) for the first 3-5 customers, then scaling to cold outreach.
